   <h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">About Current Research: </h2>
    <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> My research focuses on intelligent sensing and WiFi sensing,
	    exploring the integration of advanced sensor technologies with artificial intelligence concentration on 
	    Machine Learning to enhance data collection, analysis, and prediction. 
	    Specifically, I investigate how WiFi signals can be used for non-intrusive monitoring of environments 
	    and activities. In recent years wifi sensing has been an emerging area of research. 
	    Wifi signals (Radio Frequency Signals) are ubiquitous and non-intrusive, 
	    they can be used to track or detect the movement of objects through the wall i.e. called through wall sensing.  
	    By analyzing variations in WiFi signal patterns, my work aims to develop accurate and
	    efficient methods for detecting human presence, movements, and even specific gestures without the
	    need for wearable devices. This research has significant implications for smart homes, healthcare, and security 
	    applications, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time monitoring and automation.</p>

  <h2  style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">Inteligent Sensing: </h2>
   <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> Intelligent sensing is a cutting-edge field that integrates
	   advanced sensors with artificial intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to enhance the collection, 
	   processing, and interpretation of data from the environment. These systems leverage sophisticated algorithms 
	   and machine learning techniques to analyze sensory inputs in real time, enabling more accurate and efficient
	   decision-making processes. Intelligent sensing technologies are pivotal in various applications, including 
	   autonomous vehicles, healthcare diagnostics, industrial automation, and environmental monitoring. 
	   By providing high-resolution, context-aware insights, intelligent sensing not only improves operational
	   efficiency but also opens new avenues for innovation and smarter solutions in numerous domains.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;"> Intelligent Non-contact Ultrasonic Sensor:</h2>
   <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> Intelligent sensing using non-contact ultrasonic sensors
	   is an innovative approach that combines the precision of ultrasonic technology with the power of 
	   artificial intelligence (AI) to create highly efficient and versatile sensing systems. 
	   Non-contact ultrasonic sensors use high-frequency sound waves to detect objects and measure
	   distances without physical contact, making them ideal for applications where traditional contact-based 
	   methods are impractical or could cause damage. By integrating AI, these sensors can analyze the 
	   reflected sound waves in real-time, distinguishing between different materials, shapes, and sizes with high accuracy.
	   This intelligent processing capability enhances applications such as robotic navigation, industrial automation, 
	   and environmental monitoring by providing precise, reliable data even in challenging conditions like dust,
	   smoke, or varying lighting. The fusion of AI with ultrasonic sensing not only improves performance but
	   also enables the development of smarter, adaptive systems that can learn and improve over time, driving 
	   advancements in technology and operational efficiency across various sectors.</p>
 
   <h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px; font-size: 20px;">Device Free WiFi Sensing (DFWS):</h2>
	<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Device Free WiFi Sensing (DFWS) sensing are innovative techniques that leverage wireless signals to detect and monitor various activities and 
		environmental changes without relying on traditional sensors or direct interaction with devices.

<h3>WiFi sensing:</h3> <p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;"> Utilizes existing WiFi signals to sense changes in the environment.
	    By analyzing the way WiFi signals are altered by the presence and movement of objects and people, 
	    this technology can detect activities, track movements, and even recognize gestures.
	    This approach takes advantage of the ubiquitous presence of WiFi networks, making it a cost-effective and 
	    scalable solution for applications like home security, elderly care, and smart home automation.
	    WiFi sensing can monitor occupancy, detect falls, and provide insights into the usage patterns of
	    different spaces, all without requiring users to carry or interact with specific devices.</p>

<h3>Device-Free Sensing:</h3>
<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Device-free sensing, as the name suggests, involves monitoring and detecting activities or changes
	    in the environment without requiring individuals to carry any specific device. 
	    This method often uses passive sensors, such as cameras, microphones, or ambient sensors, 
	    and leverages signal processing and AI to interpret the data. Device-free sensing is valuable in 
	    scenarios where wearing or carrying a device is impractical, such as in surveillance, elderly care, 
	    and public safety. By analyzing patterns and anomalies in the data collected from the environment, 
	    these systems can provide valuable insights and trigger alerts for various events, such as intrusions,
	    health emergencies, or environmental changes.</p>

<p align="justify" style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.7;">Device Free WiFI Sensing represent significant advancements in the field of intelligent sensing, offering non-intrusive, cost-effective, and versatile solutions for a wide range of applications.
By harnessing the power of existing infrastructure and advanced analytics, these technologies enhance our ability to monitor
	and interact with the world around us in a more seamless and efficient manner.</p>
